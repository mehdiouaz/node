/*  MY FIRST ASYNC I/O! (Exercise 4 of 13)  
   
  Write a program that uses a single asynchronous filesystem operation to  
  read a file and print the number of newlines it contains to the console  
  (stdout), similar to running cat file | wc -l.  
   
  The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first  
  command-line argument.
